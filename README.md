"fun with yql"

DOCUMENTATION: 

This ticker uses one webpage "index.php" along with AJAX to switch up it's yql query to 
whatever ticker the user types in the input box. 

There is a ton of more data that gets returned by the query that isn't displayed, but it is all 
console logged so just right click on your browser -> inspect element -> console and 
drop the Object down to view all the fields returned.

NOTE: if you do not have a virtual server running on your local machine simply change "index.php"
to "index.html"
